            <h2>Branching and Merging</h2>
          <p>Branching is the act of creating multiple copies of similar code in the same repository. When code is fine-tuned and tested in the branch, and we know it works, we can add it into master. This process is called merging. I have learned how to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create a branch</li>
            <li>Push newly created feature branch to my repository</li>
            <li>Switch between master branch and feature branches</li>
            <li>Merge feature branch to master branch</li>
            <li>Deleting feature branches</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
